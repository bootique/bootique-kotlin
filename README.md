# bootique-kotlin

**WARNING: the last release of Bootique that supports "bootique-kotlin" is 3.0. It is currently deprecated, and will 
be removed from Bootique 4.0. We recommend Kotlin developers to switch to the "regular" Bootique API, or to fork this 
module and support it on their own.**

Provides extension function and features for smooth development with [Bootique](http://bootique.io/) and [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/).
